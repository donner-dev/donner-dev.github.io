                  <p>
                    C'est La Brie is my passion project. 
                    I started developing and designing this brand for a course a couple of years ago, and i brought to myself the challenge of COMPLETELY redesigning it 
                    making use of the tools and experience i acquired through the years.
                    From Figma wireframing to Final Production, 
                    this artisanal cheese e-commerce platform was carefully designed around user experience and best practices in mind, always prioritizing branding and of course user experience.
                    
                   (!) This project also allowed me the opportunity to expand my skills to backend, 
                   effectively teaching myself how to design and handle a business database with the clients, products and sales statistics.
                   You can browse the fine dairy products and add them to your cart.
                   Managing a project of this scale by my own taught me a lot of management and problem-solving skills, so even if ardous, it armed me with plenty of experience on all things web.
